The NEAR Protocol is a scalable and user-friendly blockchain platform designed to power the next generation of decentralized applications. With its focus on simplifying the developer and user experience, NEAR is poised to drive mass-adoption of web3 technologies. 

BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd)'s integration with NEAR addresses one of the most significant barriers to entry for new web3 users - the onboarding process. By automating wallet generation, securely storing private keys, and enabling seamless wallet management through each person's BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) profile, users can easily interact with NEAR-based applications. This streamlined approach accelerates user onboarding, reduces friction, and fosters a more inclusive web3 ecosystem, empowering a wider audience to participate in the decentralized revolution.

The integration offers the following features:

- **Automatic wallet creation**<br />
   When the integration is configured, BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) will automatically create a NEAR wallet for each user. This eliminates the need for users to manually create a wallet, streamlining the onboarding process and making it more user-friendly.

- **On-Demand wallet creation**<br />
   The integration can be configured so that a NEAR wallet is not created automatically upon user sign-in. In this
   configuration, you can manually trigger the creation of the NEAR wallet at any point. See our [examples page](/configuration/web3/near-examples).

- **Secure private key storage**<br />
   BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) securely stores the private key associated with each user's NEAR wallet using double encryption. This ensures that the private key remains safe from unauthorized access, providing a high level of security for users' assets.

- **User wallet access**<br />
   Users can view their NEAR wallet balance and transaction history through the BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) profile. This provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their wallet without needing to use a separate interface.
