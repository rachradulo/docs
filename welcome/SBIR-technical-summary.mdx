## Technical Summary for Rownd's Phase II SBIR Effort with BESPIN

### Introduction
Rownd, a data governance and authentication startup, has successfully completed its Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) effort in collaboration with BESPIN. The primary goals of this effort were to onboard Rownd into the government cloud, implement enterprise Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for various stakeholders, integrate with APIs, focus on the Data as a Service effort, integrate with the BESPIN design system, and conduct in-depth user research. This document provides a summary of the work completed, the anticipated government benefits, and the next steps for the project.

## Work Completed
Rownd's dedicated team worked hand-in-hand with end-users throughout the Phase II SBIR effort, successfully completing the following tasks:
- Transitioned to Gov Cloud's Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Kubernetes.
- Migrated to an approved MySQL database.
- Integrated BESPIN Terraform templates for SSL and CDN.
- Enhanced the RBAC system by introducing an "Owner" role.
- Integrated with BESPIN systems through collaboration on Tyk APIs.
- Developed SDKs for approved BESPIN coding frameworks.
- Incorporated the BESPIN design system into the Airmen Data Platform experience.

## Move to Gov Cloud
The transition from Kubernetes to Gov Cloud's Elastic Container Service (ECS) was a well-prepared and successful endeavor, despite challenges imposed by restrictions in the government cloud environment. Rownd also migrated to a government cloud-approved MySQL database and integrated BESPIN Terraform templates for SSL and CDN.

## Add Enterprise RBAC
Rownd introduced a new layer to its RBAC system, allowing for an "Owner" role. These Owners, as top-level platform administrators, can add applications, data types, and new APIs/data sources (integrations).

## Integrate into BESPIN systems
Rownd integrated with Tyk APIs as part of the Access Connect, Data Connect (AC DC) effort, adding a governance layer for Airmen-specific data. Additionally, Rownd developed SDKs for approved BESPIN coding frameworks (Flutter, React-native, React, Node) and seamlessly integrated the BESPIN design system for a seamless and white-labeled experience on the Airmen Data Platform.

Throughout the project, Rownd conducted interviews with 30+ Airmen, civilians, and contractors, participated in 50+ standups and weekly progress meetings, and administered surveys to gather user feedback. Key takeaways from user interviews include:
1. Airmen Developers have a wide range of expertise, greater than in the private sector.
2. Airmen developers prefer SDKs when coding and lack a solid foundation for utilizing APIs.
3. Only 1 in 8 developers has pushed code to a production application.

## Anticipated Government Benefits
The anticipated benefits of Rownd's platform are substantial, including significant time savings for both app developers and the approval process. By streamlining and simplifying data access and management, Rownd is projected to save 80 hours per app in development time. Furthermore, when fully implemented, the platform is expected to save 1-3 months in the app approval process, increasing efficiency and enabling faster deployment of critical applications. These benefits demonstrate the value of Rownd's platform and its potential to significantly enhance overall productivity and data governance within the government cloud environment. Other anticipated benefits include:
- Data Owners gain confidence in app-data access.
- BESPIN benefits from enhanced governance and security.
- Airmen Developers receive the necessary tools to succeed.

## Next Steps
Rownd has proposed a Phase III effort to transition the prototype from the government cloud (Development) to Cloud One (Production). This process will involve a full security audit and remediation.

## Conclusion:
The successful completion of Rownd's Phase II SBIR effort with BESPIN demonstrates the platform's ability to provide robust data governance and authentication in a government cloud environment. By addressing the needs of Data Owners, BESPIN teams, and Airmen Developers, Rownd has made complex systems more accessible and secure. The proposed Phase III effort will further solidify Rownd's integration with BESPIN and bring the platform to production readiness, offering even greater benefits to the government.
