# Sustainment Guide for the BESPIN Airmen Data Platform - powered by Rownd

## Introduction

The BESPIN Airmen Data Platform is a Phase II SBIR R&D effort focused on creating and testing prototype. This platform is not intended for production use and should only be utilized for research and development purposes. The codebase of the platform is managed and updated by Rownd, Inc. The containers and user interface components can be used by BESPIN for R&D and testing purposes. 

## Documentation and Maintenance

This document serves as a guide for using the platform and maintaining the containers. It provides instructions and guidelines for various aspects of the platform's usage, configuration, and maintenance.  Please refer to the  [technical summary](/welcome/SBIR-technical-summary.mdx) for more information around long term sustainment. 

### Platform Usage

The platform provides functionalities specifically designed for the BESPIN Airmen Data project. It includes features such as data management, analysis tools, and reporting capabilities. Detailed instructions on how to use the platform's features can be found in the provided user documentation.  

### Container Maintenance

The platform utilizes containers to deploy various components. The containers are pre-built and provided by Rownd, Inc. As a part of the platform maintenance, it is important to keep the containers up to date. Regularly check for updates and new versions provided by Rownd, Inc., and follow the recommended update process to ensure the latest features and bug fixes are incorporated into the platform.

### Moving to Cloud One Production

Before considering a production deployment on the Cloud One environment, further research and development, as well as security assessments, audits, and remediation, are required. The BESPIN Airmen Data Platform must undergo thorough evaluations to meet the necessary security standards and compliance requirements before being considered for Cloud One production.

### SDK access and maitenance.
The Rownd SDKs are open-source and can be accessed directly through links in the SDK section of these docs.  For this R&D effort, Rownd built in simple ways to update the root API and HUB location to be customized for BESPIN needs.
