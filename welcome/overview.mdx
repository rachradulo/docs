## Increased sign-in rates

By offering a diverse range of sign-in methods, adaptive authentication, and a seamless user experience, Rownd can significantly increase sign-in rates. A tailored authentication process can lead to higher user engagement and retention, as users are more likely to continue using an app that offers a smooth and convenient sign-in experience.

Rownd is an innovative authentication platform designed to provide secure and user-friendly authentication methods for websites and mobile apps. By offering a variety of authentication options, such as email-based, SMS-based, and social sign-in methods, web3 wallet, and now passkeys. Rownd simplifies the user experience while maintaining strong security measures.

One of the key benefits of using Rownd is its ability to significantly increase conversion rates. Traditional authentication methods often lead to user drop-off, with nearly half of app users abandoning the process due to complex or time-consuming sign-up steps. By streamlining the authentication process and offering multiple, convenient options, Rownd helps businesses minimize user drop-off and maximize conversion rates. This results in a larger, more engaged user base and greater overall success for your app. 

<Info>
Many website visitors get close to trying out your product, but are deterred by a sign up or registration process that asks for too much information (e.g., name, email address, password, etc).

While social sign-in (e.g., Google or Facebook) is often seen as a solution to this problem, it can also be a deterrent to visitors that might not want their profile information transmitted to you before they trust your company.

Rownd helps you build lasting relationships with your users without extra work on your part.
