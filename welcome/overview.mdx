Welcome to the Airmen Data Platform documentation! This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know to implement and make the most of this goverance and data platform.  

## What is the Airmen Data Platform
This platform is an R&D prototype and not configured or approved for production use-cases.

The Airmen Data Platform allows Airmen developers to quickly connect to approved data sources to build out Airmen profiles.  This is limited to scoped personal data (ie, the end user's data) since this is the hardest data to contain and manage.  Currently, Rownd authentication must be used to validate the END user, as a part of this effort.



## What is AC/DC
AC DC is an API platform. 

## Getting started
1. Contact Airmen Data Platform to get added to the platform
2. Login using "Sign in with Google"
3. Grab keys and use SDK to access data


## User management

Airmen Data Platform's user management system enables you to easily manage and track user accounts while providing a seamless authentication experience. With Airmen Data Platform, each user is associated with a unique identifier, allowing them to link multiple authentication methods to a single account. This prevents the creation of duplicate accounts and ensures a consistent user experience across various authentication methods.

For more information on Airmen Data Platform's user management capabilities and how it enhances the authentication process, see our [user management](./../configuration/user-profiles) documentation.
