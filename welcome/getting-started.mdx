3. After the app is created, a Javascript code snippet will be generated. Click
   the copy button to store it in your clipboard.

### Installing BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) on your websites

The BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) code snippet is a short block of javascript that you can embed into your site to enable BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) contextual authentication. Once embedded, the snippet allows BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) to handle user authentication, fetch user data, enforce [automations](/configuration/automations), and much more. 

Embedding the snippet will also display the BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) Hub in the bottom left-hand corner of your website by default. Users can click on the Hub to view their profile information, sign out, and perform other account management actions. If you provide access to these actions through other elements of your UX, the Hub can be hidden.

#### Finding your snippet

You can find the snippet in the [BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) Platform](https://https://app.dev.rownd.teambespin.us).

1. Select the **Code** item from the left navigation menu.
2. Press the **Copy** icon in the top right corner of the code box beneath **HTML snippet**.

#### Deploying the snippet

After copying the code snippet, you'll need to add it to your website(s). Most
website builder software or content management systems (CMS) have an option to
embed "custom HTML" or "custom code" in your site's pages. We usually recommend
placing the snippet just before the closing `</body>` tag.

those codebases. Our SDKs provide tight integrations to your user experience so
users can seamlessly transition from one part of your product to the
next—personalization included.

Additionally, if you're deploying back-end code to servers or are using a serverless platform like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to implement custom logic, you'll likely need to accept and validate BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) authentication tokens. Leverage our selection of [back-end SDKs](/web) to easily handle this use case.
