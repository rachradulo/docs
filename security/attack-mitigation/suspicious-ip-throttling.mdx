title: Suspicious IP throttling
description: "Automatic and always learning"

To protect your applications from high-velocity attacks targeting multiple accounts, BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) uses suspicious IP throttling to block traffic from any IP that rapidly attempts too many sign-ins or sign-ups.

This feature is automatically enabled when you create a BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) app. If BESPIN Airmen Data Platform (powered by Rownd) detects a large number of sign-up or sign-in attempts from a single IP address, it will temporarily block further attempts from that IP. 

We do not disclose our throttling strategy since they change depending on the threat environment. If you'd like to modify your settings, please [contact us](mailto:support@rownd.io?subject=Adjust%20IP%20throttling).
